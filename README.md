Hackathon Project - Streamlit NLP Application
Tech Titans Hackathon Project

Team: Tech Titans
This project was developed by Team Tech Titans as part of a hackathon. Our goal was to leverage Streamlit and NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques to create an innovative and user-friendly application.

Project Description
The project aims to build an interactive application that utilizes NLP for various text processing and analysis tasks. The application is built using Streamlit, a Python framework for creating web applications with ease.

Features
The application offers the following key features:

Text Preprocessing: Users can input raw text and apply various preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and lemmatization.

Sentiment Analysis: The application can analyze the sentiment of a given text and provide insights on whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): Users can extract entities such as names, organizations, locations, and more from a text using NER techniques.

Text Summarization: The application can generate a concise summary of a long text, making it easier for users to grasp the main points.

Language Translation: Users can translate text from one language to another using the built-in translation feature.

Installation and Setup
